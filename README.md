# break-me-down-spring-security
this is a project that I am creating for a friend of mine who is doing cyber security & learning some types of cyber attacks like Phishing, Distributed Denial-of-Service, SQL injection, Business Email Compromise, Man-in-the-middle attack and Password Attack.  He is also doing network administration, he mastered Windows Server as a professional. It's gonna help him apply the concepts that he has learned so far. It will be not secure at first and I will be adding more security as the time goes by depending on his targets.
